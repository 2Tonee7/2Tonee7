- **[The Economic Management and Organization of a Cinema Using Relational Databases](cinema_project.pdf)**

   This project is a relational database system designed to manage the economic and operational aspects of a cinema. It handles customer records, movie scheduling, reservations, ticketing, and financial tracking. The database schema consists of multiple interconnected tables, enforcing data integrity through primary and foreign keys.  

    The implementation includes various SQL operations such as data definition (`CREATE`, `ALTER`), data manipulation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), and complex queries (`SELECT` with `JOIN`, subqueries, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`). Indexes are used to optimize performance, while views provide simplified data access. Additional features include sequences for unique ID generation and synonyms for aliasing tables. Advanced SQL functions like `CASE`, `DECODE`, and date calculations enhance query flexibility.  

    Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in designing efficient relational database structures, ensuring data consistency, and optimizing query performance for real-world business applications.
